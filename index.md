Hello! My name is Sandeep Kumar and I am currently an engineer at Qualcomm. My focus has been on designing and enhancing Wired Peripherals Digital IPs. Major contributions include the development of new low-power cores, developing unique techniques to enhance their performance/low power, and resolving software/customer (OEM) issues in pre and post-silicon. Throughout this process, I have discovered a passion for research coupled with a strong motivation for collaboration, innovation, and execution. As an incoming Ph.D. student, I am motivated to build on this approach and delve deeply into the field of circuit design, with an emphasis on Analog/RFIC design and Energy-efficient Hardware architecture.  

Please find my [CV](https://sandeep-kumaar.github.io/main/cv/) for a list of my contributions,[Statement of Purpose](https://sandeep-kumaar.github.io/main/sop/) and [Personal Statement](https://sandeep-kumaar.github.io/main/ps/).
